I'm currently under the weather with a head cold, but there is misinformation being spread by the US Government that should be addressed with the contradictory evidence sooner rather than later.

## Short Summary

Yesterday, on January 7th, 2026, an [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She was not the target of any ICE activities, and was instead a local protester objecting to ICE activity in her neighborhood.

## What Trump and DHS Say Happened

Donald Trump ([Current USA President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)) and Kristi Noem (representing the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/)) made the following claims:
1. Renee Good was blocking ICE officers from leaving.[^1]
2. Renee Good tried to run over ICE in an attempt to kill them.[^1][^2][^3]
3. The ICE officer fired defensive shots.[^1][^2][^3]
4. That the officer was injured[^1] / it's "hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital"[^3]

## Video evidence contradicts claims

I was originally going to compile the various bystander videos of the incident that I had seen, but the journalists at the New York Times beat me to the punch:

1. **Claim:** Renee Good was blocking ICE officers from leaving.<br>**Evidence:** She waved the ICE vehicles forward, reversing and allowing one to exit and waving for the rest to follow. Rather than leaving, the officers got out of their vehicles to remove Renee Good from her vehicle.
2. **Claim:** Renee Good tried to run over ICE in an attempt to kill them.<br>**Evidence:** She tried to flee when ICE officers attempted to forcibly open her car door and remove her from the vehicle. The wheels of her vehicle were clearly pointed away from the officers in question at the time of being shot. The officer drew their gun before the vehicle started moving forward, rather than getting out of the way.
3. **Claim:** The ICE officer fired defensive shots.<br>**Evidence:** The officer shot at someone trying to leave, not run anyone over. Also, shooting at the driver would not stop the momentum of the vehicle.
4. **Claim:** The ICE officer was viciously ran over and is recovering in the hospital.<br>**Evidence:** The video evidence clearly shows the officer walking calmly away from the scene while checking their phone, later getting in their vehicle to drive away from the scene without assistance. No visible injuries or signs of even mild discomfort.

## US Federal Government Blocks Independent Investigation by State Law Enforcement

 The [U.S. Attorney's Office](https://www.justice.gov/usao) has barred independent investigation of the incident by the [Minneasota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA)](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/bca).[^4] Instead, it will be lead exclusively by the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/), rather than a joint investigation by the FBI and BCA.
