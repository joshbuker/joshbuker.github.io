## `whoami`
{: style="margin-top: 0;" }

Hi there! My name is Josh Buker ([IPA](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org): `/'bjuːkə/`). Historically I'd consider myself a software engineer, while long term my trajectory involves robotics and a more holistic engineering perspective. Currently I'm doing a tour of duty in the cybersecurity industry, bringing my previous developer experience and combining it with the world's current security needs.
