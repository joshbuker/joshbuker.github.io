<!-- outline-start -->

When it comes to working on a project, it can be tempting to jump straight into the fray and work on whatever the first steps are that come to mind. For smaller projects, this strategy often works just fine, allowing you to get things done with minimal overhead. However for larger projects, there can often be project stalling roadblocks that could have been prevented with prior planning.

This is why project planning can be critical to the success of more difficult endeavors. But what does a good project plan look like? How do you know you're working through what you need to ensure success? My hope is that gaming through this for my own work, and formatting it in a way to share with others, will help answer those questions and give a template from which to start any large project.

For the process I followed, see my [Project Plan Outline Journaling](obsidian://open?vault=notes&file=Evergreen%20Notes%2FProject%20Plan%20Outline%20Journaling).
